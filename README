What is guitune ?
-----------------
   Guitune is a program for tuning guitars (and other instruments).
   It is actually an oscilloscope which counts the passes between two
   trigger levels per time, calculates the frequency and shows the
   tone on a tone-scale.

   Note: the 'moc_*' files are not deleted by 'make clean'
   
   program also compiles for qt-2.X.X
   
   
   PROBLEMS:
   
   If you have qt-1.4X and qt-2.X.X coexisting on one system you have to 
   take care that all links to libraries or tools
   e.g. /usr/lib/libqt.so  or /usr/bin/moc 
   should point to files from the same version
   
   Furthermore delete all moc_* files (if existing) before "make" because 
   they differ between qt-1.4X and qt-2.X.X
